# ClothMod
A RimWorld mod where I try to make recipes feel little more "logical".

If you want to go even more "realistic" try the mod ['T'ExpandedCloth] (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1543550117).

# 1.5
Added a check for the mod [Vanilla Furniture Expanded](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1718190143).
This means that if you want to have a little more cloth to your beds, this mod now adds it.
