Makes recipes feel little more "logical".

This will make starting scenarios unable to build beds if there's no Cloth added to the base drops.

Recips changes:
- Sandbag: from 5 steel -> 3 steel and 2 Cloth.
- Bed: Stuff from 45 -> 35 Stuff and 10 Cloth.
- Double Bed: Stuff from 85 -> 65 Stuff and 20 Cloth.
- Royal Bed: Stuff from 100 and 50 Gold -> 80 Stuff, 50 Gold and 20 Cloth.
- Hospital Bed: Steel from 80 -> 70 Steel and 10 Cloth.
- Armchair: stuff 110 -> 80 stuff and 30 woodlog.

1.1 addition:
Changed the armchair to require a little backbone structure (added woodlog).

1.2 addition:
Addes some tests to see if items exists (For mod compability since some mods remove items).

1.3 update:
Updated reciepts to RimWorld 0.19 amounts.

1.4 update:
Updated reciepts to RimWorld 1.0.</description>
